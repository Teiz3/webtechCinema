          Eugene H. Krabs (Mr. Krabs) is a greedy crab who owns the Krusty Krab fast food restaurant. He is mainly driven by money
          and would make use of every exploit in order to get as much money as he can. Mr. Krabs has just opened up a 2nd Krusty Krab restaurant right beside the first one.

        <h2>King Neptune</h2>
        <p>
          King Neptune is the ruler of the ocean. He shows a lot of tyranny in his rule, smiting mortals who talk back at him. Neptune's crown is very important to him,
          as it's not only a status symbol, but also helps cover up his balding head. After finding his crown stolen with a note left behind stating that it was 
          Mr. Krabs that stole it, he went to the Krusty Krab in order to fry him. He got talked out of it by SpongeBob and his daughter Mindy,
          and gave SpongeBob 6 days to find and return his crown.

        <h2>Princess Mindy</h2>
        <p>
          Princess Mindy is the daughter of King Neptune. Unlike her father, Mindy shows a lot more compassion towards the average sealife, even learning everyone's names.
          Mindy helps out SpongeBob and Patrick throughout their task, such as giving them a bag of air to get back safely.
